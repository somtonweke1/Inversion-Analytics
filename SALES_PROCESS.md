## **ðŸ’¡ OBJECTION HANDLING**

### **"We're not looking to change anything right now."**

You can implement these changes when it makes sense for [Company]. The analysis is free, and you have nothing to lose by seeing what's possible."

### **"We already have consultants."**

**Response:** "There's no catch. We're building our client base, so we're offering free analyses to demonstrate our capabilities.

### **"We need to think about it."**
**Response:** "Of course. Let me send you the detailed analysis report and implementation plan. I'll follow up in a week to answer any questions you might have. In the meantime, if you have any questions about the analysis or implementation, feel free to reach out."
